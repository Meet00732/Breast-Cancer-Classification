# Breast Cancer Classification
This project is focused on the classification of breast cancer diagnoses using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set. It explores various machine learning approaches, including supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised learning, to predict whether a tumor is benign or malignant. The goal is to leverage different algorithms and techniques to improve prediction accuracy and understand the strengths and weaknesses of each method in the context of medical diagnosis.

Overview
The notebook is structured as follows:

Introduction to Machine Learning Types: A brief explanation of supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised learning.
Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set: An overview of the dataset used, including its features and significance.
Monte-Carlo Simulation: Application of Monte-Carlo Simulation to enhance the robustness of the learning models.
Learning Methodologies:
Supervised Learning: Implementation of supervised learning algorithms to classify the tumors.
Semi-Supervised Learning / Self-Training: Exploration of semi-supervised learning techniques, leveraging a small amount of labeled data alongside a larger set of unlabeled data.
Unsupervised Learning: Application of unsupervised learning to identify patterns without using labeled data.
Spectral Clustering: Use of spectral clustering for grouping data points based on their similarity.
